# COFFEE FACTORY PRODUCT RECORD SYSYTEM

## WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

Farmers face a challenge of not knowing how to deliver their products/produces to factories for production. They also face a challenge where records of their payments are untraceable forcing them to wait or not get paid. Factory staffs also face challenge as most recording is done manually of file storage. Each farmer is identified with their id number so as to retrive their records

## WHAT'S THE SOLUTION THEN?

**Coffee Factory Record Rystem**

What's this? This is our solution to the current problem. It is a web based platform that enables coffee farmers to notify their preffered factory about their produces. Farmers are then given a collection date when they can deliver it to the factory or the factory staff can come to collect.

**`What's special?`**
Customers don't have to worry about records getting lost or cueing as they wait for file retrival. Measurement records are recorded upon measurement and only and only the factory admin has the clearance to alter the records in which the farmer must be notified before any change. If records are altered in any order a record is kept showing date altered, by who and the changes.

`Technologies used in development:`

    1. Python v. 3
    2. Django framework v. 2.2.6
    3. Django API support

More on the API find it in the documentation.

React frontend application to be writen to interact with the API.
